NOTICE
======

... a quick word about renaming.


Just a quick notice to anyone potentially tracking these repositories: we've been informed that 
we are causing some confusion with an IT-system house named anykey GmbH.

In case you are looking for Oracle, EMC, or similar data center solutions, we apologize for any 
inconvenience or confusion we may have caused. You want to be [here](http://www.anykey.de/).

If you're looking for the Open Source ARM Cortex M3 embedded development board, we've moved all 
our Open Source efforts to the github account [presseverykey](https://github.com/presseverykey).

Thanks and again, apologies for any confusion.
